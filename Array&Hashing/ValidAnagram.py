    242. Valid Anagram

    Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

    An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase,
    typically using all the original letters exactly once.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
    Output: true
    Example 2:

    Input: s = "rat", t = "car"
    Output: false

    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length, t.length <= 5 * 10^4
    s and t consist of lowercase English letters.

    Follow up: What if the inputs contain Unicode characters? How would you adapt your solution to such a case?

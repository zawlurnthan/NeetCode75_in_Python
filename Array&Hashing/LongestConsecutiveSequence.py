    128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

    Given an unsorted array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

    You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

    Example 1:

    Input: nums = [100,4,200,1,3,2]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: The longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4]. Therefore its length is 4.

    Example 2:

    Input: nums = [0,3,7,2,5,8,4,6,0,1]
    Output: 9


    Constraints:

    0 <= nums.length <= 10^5
    -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

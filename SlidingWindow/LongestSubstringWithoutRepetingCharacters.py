    3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

    Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "abcabcbb"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.


    Example 2:

    Input: s = "bbbbb"
    Output: 1
    Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.


    Example 3:

    Input: s = "pwwkew"
    Output: 3
    Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
    Notice that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.


    Constraints:

    0 <= s.length <= 5 * 104
    s consists of English letters, digits, symbols and spaces.

    424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement

    You are given a string s and an integer k. You can choose any character of the string and
    change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most k times.

    Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after
    performing the above operations.

    Example 1:

    Input: s = "ABAB", k = 2
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

    Example 2:

    Input: s = "AABABBA", k = 1
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' and form "AABBBBA".
    The substring "BBBB" has the longest repeating letters, which is 4.


    Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 10^5
    s consists of only uppercase English letters.
    0 <= k <= s.length
